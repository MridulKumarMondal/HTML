      One of the most incredible places in India, Kashmir is known for its
      natural beauty and is thus, rightly called Heaven on Earth. With its
      picturesque lakes, lush fruit orchards, verdant meadows, pines and deodars
      forests, all enclosed with mountains of Himalayan and Pir-Panjal ranges –
      Kashmir seems to have directly made its way right out from a postcard. The
      beautiful Kashmir Valley is home to many destinations ideal for nature
      lovers, family vacationers, honeymooners, and even a group of friends.
      Along with great sightseeing opportunities, it offers adventure activities
      like trekking, skiing, and river rafting, recreational activities like
      fishing & angling, and even spa & wellness. Shopaholics and food lovers
      can also have their share of enjoyment as Kashmir spoils them with many
      options.
